# Implementation Rules

These rules apply to every `spec/*/task*.md`. The generated graph and transport
contracts are the source of truth; business implementations and their tests are
user-owned extension points.

## Project invariants

- Project root: `example/`
- Graph: `example/graph/example.yaml`
- Never edit a file whose name contains `generated`; those files are replaced
  during project merge.
- Never change generated signatures, topology wiring, IDs, config keys, or
  transport contracts in order to make an implementation easier.
- Change `.proto`/OpenAPI source and regenerate; never patch generated bindings.
- Preserve the message/stream context received from the framework.
- Do not keep mutable per-request state in function objects: function instances
  are created once and may process requests concurrently.
- Finish one task at a time and immediately copy its completion line to
  `spec/progress.md`.

## Services

| Service | Language | Directory |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| `Inventory Service` | `C++` | `inventoryservice/` |
| `Order Service` | `C++` | `orderservice/` |




## C++/userver rules

- Function objects must satisfy the concepts checked by generated stream
  construction. Keep the exact `operator()`/handler method surface in the
  generated user-owned header.
- Treat `servicelib::MessageContext` as request/message metadata and propagate
  it through collectors. Respect `Payload<T>` ownership; do not retain borrowed
  references beyond a synchronous call.
- C++ builds and tests are Docker-canonical:
  - build: `./scripts/build.generated.sh`
  - test: `./scripts/test.generated.sh`
  - lint: `./scripts/lint.generated.sh`
- Regenerate protobuf/OpenAPI bindings through the generated CMake/Docker
  workflow, never by invoking `protoc` or userver generators manually.
- Implement the adjacent `*_test.cpp` file with userver `utest`.
- Do not modify `*_generated.hpp`, `*_generated.cpp`, generated protobuf, or
  generated OpenAPI sources.




## Endpoint and serialization rules

- External request/response types belong to protobuf/OpenAPI contracts.
- Internal stream types belong to the language backend's model package.
- Convert between external and internal types in endpoint handlers.
- Add serialization only where data crosses a process/storage boundary.
- For source endpoints, verify a real request and include the command in the
  task completion entry when the task asks for it.

## Priority of truth

1. Current task file.
2. Graph definition.
3. `.proto`/OpenAPI source contracts.
4. Generated type signatures.
5. servicelib runtime semantics for the selected language.
